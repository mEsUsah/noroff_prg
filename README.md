# Programming class at Noroff NIS (2023)
In this repo I will post my solution for the tasks and assingments in the Programming 
class at the Network and Information Security program at Noroff Vocational Collage.


## PRG_module_* folders
Contain solutions to tasks and asignments, organized by module in Moodle.

The in-chapter tasks and end-of-section assignments are named according to the following convention:
```
module.chapter.assignment_description

Example: 4.1.1_generateLetters.py
- Module 4
- Chapter 1
- Assignment 1
- The generateLettets assignment

Example: 4.2.0_p13_reType.py
- Module 4
- Chapter 2
- No assingment
- Page 13 in the Moodle lecture
- Name I gave the task: "reType"
```


## PCAP_module_* folder
Contains solutions to tasks in the Python essentials course by the python institute.

I HIGHLY(!!!) recommend any student to read the material, and study for the PCEP and PCAP certification. It's free and of high quality. When stydying at Noroff i did this as extracurricular material for deeper studies in programming with Python specifically, and depening my programming understanding in general. I connected a lot of dots, and learned a lot!
