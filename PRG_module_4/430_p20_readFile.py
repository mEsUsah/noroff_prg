    Write a Python script that opens a text file, reads its contents, and displays 
    it to the command-line. 
    
    After displaying the contents, the script should request values from a user 
    continuously until they choose to stop. 
    
    All values entered should be appended to the same text file of which the contents 
    were displayed at the start of the scriptâ€™s execution. 
    
    Ensure that you run the script multiple times to see how the number of values 
    in the file increases.
